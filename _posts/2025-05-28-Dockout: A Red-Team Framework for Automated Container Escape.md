## Introduction

Container escape remains a critical area in offensive security, particularly as containerized infrastructure becomes more common in production environments.  

While several public proof-of-concept (PoC) scripts and research articles exist for known escape techniques, many are designed for isolated testing and are not intended for broader operational use or integration into red-team workflows.

[Dockout](https://github.com/schoi1337/dockout) was developed to address this gap by providing:

- A modular and extensible PoC framework
- Safe simulation capabilities to support learning and CI integration
- Structured logging and reporting for traceability and audit

This post outlines the design and implementation of Dockout, including the trade-offs made to balance functionality, safety, and usability.

## Project Objectives

From the outset, the framework was designed with three priorities:

1. **Support for real exploit execution** in controlled environments  
2. **Simulation mode** to validate logic without modifying the host  
3. **Consistency and safety** through CLI prompts and structured output

The goal was to provide a system suitable for both individual testing and operational use within red-team workflows.

## Architecture

Dockout uses a modular approach where each PoC is implemented as a standalone plugin.  
Each module follows a simple interface contract:

```python
def simulate():
    # Print dry-run steps

def exploit():
    # Launch real exploit (requires --unsafe and confirmation)
```

The CLI parser in core.py handles all mode routing (`--simulate`, `--auto`, `--attack`, etc).

The directory structure:

```plaintext
dockout/
â”œâ”€â”€ attacks/                        # All exploit modules (real/simulated)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cap_abuse.py

## Report Generation

To ensure the tool remains usable in operational and educational settings, Dockout includes:
- HTML reports with time-stamped actions and results
- JSON reports for integration with external pipelines
- Risk levels and execution recommendations per exploit

This enables users to review results safely, share internally, or store artifacts for audit purposes.

## Development Considerations

Key decisions during development included:
- Each module supports both simulation and real execution paths with logging.
- Implementing interactive confirmation prompts for all real exploits
- Separating simulation logic to support CI-based validation
- Using modular file structure to simplify maintenance and future extensions
- Avoiding hardcoded assumptions about the container runtime or host OS

## Lessons Learned

- Designing with safety and reproducibility in mind leads to better tooling
- Plugin-based systems improve clarity, scalability, and maintainability
- Structured reporting is essential not only for documentation, but also for security validation and collaboration
- Simulation can be a powerful method to learn and test offensive concepts without causing unintended side effects

## Conclusion

Dockout is a continuing effort to bridge the gap between research-grade PoCs and production-grade security tooling.
While the framework is already capable of executing several well-known container escapes, the real value lies in its extensibility and safe-by-default design.
