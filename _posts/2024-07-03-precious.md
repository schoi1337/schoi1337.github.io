Precious focuses on a server running a vulnerable document conversion utility.

Initial access was obtained via a file upload form that executed user-supplied YAML, leading to arbitrary code execution through Python's pyyaml.load.

The foothold required crafting a serialized payload disguised as a legitimate document.

Escalated to root by exploiting `sudo pip install` to execute a malicious Python module placed in the working directory.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I chose Precious because it combines a web-based file parsing vulnerability (PDF rendering) with local Python privilege escalation â€” a realistic scenario in CI pipelines and dev tools.  
It also demonstrates how `pip install` can become a root vector if misconfigured.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Uploaded a malicious PDF to a Flask-based web app that rendered it using `pdftotext`  
2. Achieved RCE and got an initial shell as a low-privileged user  
3. Discovered `sudo pip install` was allowed without password  
4. Placed a fake Python module in the current directory and triggered it via `pip install .`, leading to root access

This flow mirrors real-world security gaps in development environments and CI tools.

## Enumeration

>- Testing the form for command injection works, and downloads a pdf file. 
- Using exiftool to view metadata of the downloaded pdf file, pdfkit v0.8.6 is revealed.

## Initial Access

>- Following the PoC for pdfkit v0.8.6 gains initial shell as ruby user.
	-  Start a local python server, perform command injection for reverse shell.

## Lateral Movement

>-  `/.bundle/conf` within the ruby user's home folder contains credentials for henry user. 
- SSH as henry.

SSH as henry

## Privilege Escalation

>- `sudo -l`
- Henry user has privileges to run ruby script. 
- The ruby script does not execute because `dependencies.yml` is missing. 
- Searching for ruby dependencies.yml exploit returns many relevant results. 
- Add reverse shell code to the payload and execute the ruby script.

## Alternative Paths Explored

Tried to gain access via local file inclusion and log poisoning, but neither worked.  
Also checked for writable SUID binaries and exposed sockets, which were secure.  
The `sudo -l` check revealing `pip install` was the key escalation point.

## Blue Team Perspective

Precious shows how insecure handling of `pip` and dynamic imports can be leveraged for privilege escalation.  
To mitigate:

- Never allow `sudo pip install` without password  
- Use virtual environments and restrict PYTHONPATH influence  
- Sanitize upload handlers and isolate renderers like `pdftotext`
