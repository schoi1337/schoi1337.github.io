This project documents how I simulated CVE-2025-20029 and published a safe proof-of-concept.  
The goal was to better understand the vulnerability, develop a reproducible exploit flow, and structure it as a clean technical reference.

## Background

CVE-2025-20029 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting F5 BIG-IP.  
The root cause is improper deserialization of headers, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads.  

I referred to the following for initial analysis:  
- [CyberSecurityNews â€“ PoC Exploit Released for F5 BIG-IP CVE-2025-20029](https://cybersecuritynews.com/poc-exploit-released-for-f5-big-ip-cve-2025-20029/)

Rather than replicate the real system, I built a minimal Flask app that mimics the vulnerable logic.  
This allowed me to experiment with the attack vector safely.

## Structure

The project is divided into three parts:

| Path              | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/vulnerable-app` | Simulated vulnerable Flask application       |
| `/exploit`        | Python script that crafts and sends payload |
| `/README.md`      | Setup and usage instructions                |

## Approach

1. **CVE Review**  
   Read the advisory and article to understand the vulnerability flow.  
   Confirmed the deserialization vector and where the input is injected.

2. **Flask App**  
   Recreated a minimal app where headers are mishandled.  
   Focused only on the core logic needed to simulate the issue.

3. **Exploit PoC**  
   Wrote a simple Python script that sends crafted headers.  
   Added basic success/failure logging.

4. **Documentation**  
   Described all steps and design decisions in the README.  
   Separated exploit code from simulation code for clarity.

## Takeaways

- Rebuilding the vulnerable path from scratch made the CVE easier to understand.
- Keeping the app logic minimal helped isolate the critical flaw.
- Referencing public exploit breakdowns is helpful, but testing in isolation is essential.
