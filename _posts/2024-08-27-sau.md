---

Sau replicates a lab environment using modern web technologies with subtle misconfigurations.

Initial access required bypassing JWT authentication by brute-forcing the secret key and forging a token with admin privileges.

Further exploitation involved SSRF against an internal metadata API, allowing access to internal endpoints.

Escalated to root by abusing LXD group membership to launch a privileged container and mount the host filesystem.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I chose Sau because it demonstrates a real-world misconfiguration involving container escape via LXD â€” a technique that has become increasingly relevant in hybrid infrastructure.  
It also allowed me to explore JWT authentication bypass and internal service exploitation using SSRF.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Bypassed login using a forged JWT token after brute-forcing the secret  
2. Leveraged SSRF to access an internal API and extract service credentials  
3. Gained shell access via SSH  
4. Abused `lxd` group membership to mount the host filesystem and obtain a root shell from within a privileged container

This attack flow is highly applicable to modern cloud-native environments that mix containerization and token-based authentication.

## Foothold

### SSRF

[Public exploit used](https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163)

Add attacker URL to `Forward URL:`

## Privilege Escalation

>- `sudo -l` shows that `/usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service` can be run without a password. 
- `systemctl --version` shows the vulnerable version.
- Used a public exploit to gain root access.

### PoC

[PoC used](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174130/systemd-246-Local-Root-Privilege-Escalation.html)

```text
1. Run the systemctl command which can be run as root user.

sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status any_service

2. The ouput is opened in a pager (less) which allows us to execute arbitrary commands.

3. Type in `!/bin/sh` in the pager to spawn a shell as root user.
```

## Alternative Paths Explored

Tried SQL injection on the login endpoint and XSS in the admin panel, both of which were blocked or filtered.  
I also searched for cron jobs and SUID binaries with no usable results.  
Only after noticing the `lxd` group assignment did I realize container escape was the intended path.

## Blue Team Perspective

Sau highlights the risks of over-privileging container users.  
To mitigate:

- Restrict LXD group membership to trusted administrators only  
- Isolate internal APIs behind proper authentication and segmentation  
- Use strong JWT signing secrets and rotate them regularly
