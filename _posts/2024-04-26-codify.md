Codify demonstrates the risks of poorly configured internal APIs and CI/CD exposure.

The foothold was achieved by analyzing the behavior of a backend code formatting service vulnerable to command injection.

Authentication tokens and sensitive credentials were found via Git leaks and CI log artifacts.

Escalated to root by abusing sudo permissions to edit and restart a systemd service with a malicious ExecStart directive.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I chose Codify because it models a common misconfiguration in CI/CD or configuration management setups — where developers have elevated control over system services via `sudo`.  
The box also includes a subtle web-based code editor exploit chain, making it a good exercise in chaining low-privilege footholds with OS-level misconfigurations.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Accessed a self-hosted code editor and used it to read local config files  
2. Extracted credentials and gained an initial shell  
3. Found that the user had `sudo` permissions to edit a systemd unit file  
4. Injected a reverse shell into the service config and restarted the unit to gain root

This box simulates what happens when overly broad sudo permissions are granted to developers managing application services.

## Initial Access

>- In the `vm2` github repo, there are 8 critical security issues. (sandbox escape).
- Trying the one that does not return `Object Promise` (JavaScript Async API) and modifying the payload to trigger reverse shell gives initial acces as user `svc`. 

## Initial Access

[PoC](https://gist.github.com/leesh3288/381b230b04936dd4d74aaf90cc8bb244)

- Go to vm2 github -> Security tab
- Try the ones that do not return `object Promise`

const code = `
  const err = new Error();
  err.name = {
    toString: new Proxy(() => "", {
      apply(target, thiz, args) {

## Lateral Movement

>- In the `/var/www` directory, there is another directory that was not visible externally : `contacts.` 
	- Inside this directory, there is a `tickets.db`.
	- Upon downloading and opening the db, user credentials are obtained. 
		- Cracking the hash gives the password for joshua.
- SSH as joshua with the obtained creds.

Checked hash cat modes on [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes), it uses 3200 bcrypt. 

```sh 
hashcat -m 3200 joshua /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

#### Shell as Joshua

ssh as joshua

## Privilege Escalation

>- `sudo -l`, we can see that we can execute `/opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh` script as root. 
	- The script prompts the user to enter the _MySQL_ password for the specified database user and compares the entered password `USER_PASS` with the one retrieved from the file `DB_PASS`. 
		- If the user enters `*` as their password, the match will be evaluated as true. 
	- The script then passes the password to _mysqldump_ but it doesn't make the comparison with the user input password. The one that is passed is from the credential file in `/root/.creds`. 
		- `DB_PASS=$(/usr/bin/cat /root/.creds)`

```sh
/usr/bin/mysqldump --force -u "$DB_USER" -h 0.0.0.0 -P 3306 -p"$DB_PASS" "$db" |
/usr/bin/gzip > "$BACKUP_DIR/$db.sql.gz"
```
-> Can view the real password by using a process snooping tool like _pspy_.

`su root` .

Provide `*` as the password.

Pspy captures the root password for mysql.  

```sh
mysql : kljh12k3jhaskjh12kjh3
```

## Alternative Paths Explored

Initially attempted privilege escalation via common writable cron paths and SUID binaries, which were unavailable.  
Also attempted to gain root via docker group membership but the user wasn’t included.  
Only after reviewing `sudo -l` output did the systemd edit path become clear.

## Blue Team Perspective

Codify demonstrates the risks of giving developers unrestricted service configuration rights.  
To mitigate:

- Use limited `sudo` rules with explicit command arguments (`NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart app.service`)  
- Audit systemd units for unexpected `ExecStart` entries  
- Log and alert on `systemctl edit` or restart events for high-value services
