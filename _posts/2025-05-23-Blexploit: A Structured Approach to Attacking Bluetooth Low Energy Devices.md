## Introduction

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is everywhere â€” from smart locks and fitness trackers to enterprise access controls.  

Yet despite its ubiquity, BLE remains **underrepresented in structured offensive tooling**.

Most research focuses on isolated PoCs or specific CVEs.  
Whatâ€™s missing is a framework that allows attackers and researchers to:

- Map BLE environments at scale  
- Profile targets with reusable fingerprints  
- Automate attack selection and payload execution  
- Do all this **safely**, with simulation-first defaults

This post walks through how I built [Blexploit](https://github.com/schoi1337/blexploit), an open-source BLE exploitation suite grounded in **real-world reconnaissance, structured attack modeling, and modular execution logic**.

## Recon First: Exploring BLE in the Wild

I began the project by scanning real BLE devices in home and public environments using Ubertooth and BLE sniffers.  
Key patterns emerged:

- Many devices cycle MAC addresses to evade tracking  
- GATT services often overlap across vendors, but UUID structures vary  
- Passive recon collects key metadata such as device name, RSSI, advertising interval, and UUIDs.  

This led to the design of Blexploitâ€™s **intelligence modules**, including:

- `--passive-scan`: Name, MAC, RSSI, manufacturer, UUID collection  
- `--track-macs`: Detecting rotating MACs (persistence evasion)  
- `--track-unknowns`: Flagging suspicious repeaters  
- `--fingerprint`: GATT-level fingerprint creation and reuse

## Modeling Devices with Fingerprint DBs

I began building a reusable `fingerprints/` database using scanned service UUIDs.  
While characteristic permissions and device-type inference are planned, the current implementation focuses on UUID-based fingerprinting and attack suggestion.

This enables Blexploit to **suggest attacks automatically** based on a newly scanned deviceâ€™s fingerprint match.

```bash
$ python main.py passive-scan
â†’ Found device: D7:58:xx:xx:xx:xx
â†’ Collected UUIDs: ['0000fff1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb']
â†’ Suggested attacks: brute-pin, replay
```

## Exploit Integration: Safe and Structured

Every attack module in Blexploit is designed with two modes:

- `simulate()` to preview logic and test safely
- `exploit()` to launch real BLE interactions (requires --unsafe flag)

### Current Supported Techniques

| Technique                   | Module                 | Description                                           | Execution Mode | Simulation Support |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Brute-force PIN Attack      | `brute_pin.py`          | Attempts known BLE PINs from curated wordlist         | ðŸŸ¢ Real        | âœ… Supported         |
| Characteristic Replay       | `replay.py`             | Replays UUID+payload pairs from prior sessions        | ðŸŸ¢ Real        | âœ… Supported         |
| Fake Key Injection          | `simulate_fakekey.py`   | Simulates spoofed key-based unlocks                   | ðŸŸ¡ Simulated   | âœ… Supported         |
| Replay Simulation           | `simulate_replay.py`    | Simulates replay logic with static UUIDs              | ðŸŸ¡ Simulated   | âœ… Supported         |

All actions are logged in both HTML and JSON formats for traceability, demo reuse, or team analysis.

## Simulation-First Reporting

A key principle in Blexploit is: every real exploit should be previewable and explainable.

Thatâ€™s why the report system includes:
- Structured HTML report per run
- Packet logs, target metadata, risk levels
- Simulation-only annotation to prevent confusion
- Recommended next steps based on fingerprint and response

This helps red teams present findings clearly, and allows researchers to test in CI-like environments without physical devices.

## What Iâ€™d Like to Build Next

- A BLE replay sandbox using mock devices for offline testing
- Auto-clustering of fingerprints to detect device families
- Integration with Shodan BLE scan datasets for external profiling
- Firmware-based UUID matching from extracted app binaries

## Conclusion

Blexploit began as a way to explore BLE security more safely and systematically.
It has evolved into a framework for understanding, simulating, and executing real-world BLE attacks â€” with repeatability and responsibility at its core.
