[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

# h1
code block test
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Greet user and request their name
echo "The activity generator"
read -p "What is your name? " name

# Create an array of activities
activity[0]="Football"
activity[1]="Table Tennis"
activity[2]="8 Ball Pool"
activity[3]="PS5"
activity[4]="Blackjack"

array_length=${#activity[@]} # Store the length of the array
index=$(($RANDOM % $array_length)) # Randomly select an index from 0 to array_length

# Invite the user to join you participate in an activity
echo "Hi" $name, "would you like to play" ${activity[$index]}"?"
read -p "Answer: " answer
```

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
