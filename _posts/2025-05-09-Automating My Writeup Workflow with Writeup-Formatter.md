description: A utility script to convert Obsidian-style HTB writeups into Jekyll-compatible Markdown files with SEO metadata and image optimization.

## Background

I had over 80 Hack The Box writeups stored in Obsidian.  

They were inconsistent â€” missing front matter, unoptimized images, and unstructured headings.  

To publish them on my Jekyll-based blog, I needed a way to standardize formatting, generate metadata, and handle images automatically.

This led to the creation of **Writeup-Formatter**.

## Purpose

The goal was to simplify the migration of raw `.md` files into clean, blog-ready posts without manual edits.  

The script handles structure, images, and SEO formatting to reduce repetition and enforce consistency.

## Features

- Converts Obsidian-style `.md` files into `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-boxname.md`
- Randomly assigns a publish date within the past 1.5 years
- Generates front matter (`title`, `date`, `tags`, `description`)
- Normalizes image handling:
  - Renames, resizes, and compresses screenshots
  - Moves them to `/assets/images/`
  - Rewrites image links inside Markdown

## Folder Structure

### Before

```yaml
htb_writeups/
â”œâ”€â”€ forest/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ forest.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Attachments/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ screen1.png
â”œâ”€â”€ monteverde/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ monteverde.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Attachments/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ screenshot.jpg
```

### After Running the Script

```yaml
_posts/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-10-01-forest.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-09-12-monteverde.md

assets/images/
â”œâ”€â”€ forest1.png
â”œâ”€â”€ monteverde1.jpg
```

If `forest.md` is missing, the script creates a minimal template automatically.

## Front Matter Example

```yaml
---
title: "Forest"
date: 2024-08-21
tags: ["htb", "hackthebox", "forest", "writeup", "ctf", "cybersecurity"]
description: "Structured walkthrough of Forest on Hack The Box."
---
```

## Usage
1. Prepare folders under `htb_writeups/`, one per box:
- boxname.md (optional)
- `Attachments/` for screenshots
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pillow
```

## Result

The script outputs a clean, Jekyll-compatible post with structured content and image links.
This saves time when publishing multiple writeups and ensures consistency across posts.
