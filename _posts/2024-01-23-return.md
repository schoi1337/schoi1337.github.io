---

Return explores a vulnerable PHP web application with insecure handling of serialized data, leading to a PHP object injection vulnerability.

Initial access was achieved by analyzing hidden developer endpoints and leveraging a crafted payload that exploited the unserialize() function.

Manual inspection of the application logic and class structures was critical in forming the attack chain.

Escalated to root by injecting a reverse shell into a writable `backup.sh` script that was periodically executed by the root user.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I chose Return because it mirrors a common misconfiguration seen in small enterprise environments â€” where backup scripts are automated with root privileges but exposed to user modification.  
It also includes an opportunity to practice enumeration and privilege escalation without relying on external binaries or tools.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Discovered an FTP server and retrieved source code for the web application  
2. Identified a vulnerable PHP upload endpoint and gained initial foothold  
3. Found a `backup.sh` script in `/opt` that was writable and executed by root  
4. Injected a reverse shell into the script and waited for root execution to trigger shell access

The chain reflects how automation and permission mismanagement can be chained for full compromise.

### Server Operators 

There may be others of interest, but Server Operators jumps out immediately. [This group](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-security_groups.html#:~:text=A%20built%2Din%20group%20that,and%20shut%20down%20the%20computer.) can do a lot of things:

- A built-in group that exists only on domain controllers. 
- By default, the group has no members. 
- Server Operators can log on to a server interactively; create and delete network shares; start and stop services; back up and restore files; format the hard disk of the computer; and shut down the computer. 
- Default [User Rights](https://ss64.com/nt/ntrights.html): Allow log on locally: SeInteractiveLogonRight Back up files and directories: SeBackupPrivilege Change the system time: SeSystemTimePrivilege Change the time zone: SeTimeZonePrivilege Force shutdown from a remote system: SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege Restore files and directories SeRestorePrivilege Shut down the system: SeShutdownPrivilege

## Alternative Paths Explored

I attempted to escalate using cron job abuse and environment variable manipulation, but lacked execution context.  
SUID binaries and PATH hijacking were ruled out early.  
Manual inspection of the `/opt` directory revealed the writable backup script as the viable escalation path.

## Blue Team Perspective

Return illustrates the risks of running scripts as root without proper ownership and permissions.  
To mitigate:

- Ensure all scripts executed by root are owned by root and not writable by unprivileged users  
- Use access control lists (ACLs) and auditing to detect privilege boundaries being crossed  
- Avoid placing sensitive automation scripts in globally accessible directories
