---

Nibbles simulates a lightweight web server hosting a blog engine vulnerable to hardcoded credentials and file upload flaws.

Access was gained using default creds, followed by uploading a PHP reverse shell through a poorly secured admin panel.

File extension filtering was easily bypassed with common tricks, demonstrating the importance of proper server-side validation.

Escalated to root by modifying a root-owned script in a user-writable directory that was executed on login.

## Why I Chose This Machine

I selected Nibbles because it simulates a simple yet realistic developer misconfiguration scenario involving a custom CMS and insecure script permissions.  
Itâ€™s well suited for practicing file upload bypass, source review, and local enumeration for privilege escalation.

## Attack Flow Overview

1. Discovered a custom CMS and accessed its admin interface using default credentials  
2. Uploaded a reverse shell disguised as a `.php` file  
3. Gained a shell and switched to `nibbles` user via credential reuse  
4. Found a root-owned script in a writable directory and injected a reverse shell command to escalate privileges

This attack chain reflects common real-world scenarios in small dev environments.

## Alternative Paths Explored

Initially attempted directory traversal and XSS, which were blocked.  
Also explored cron jobs, SUID binaries, and sudo rights but none were exploitable.  
Success came from inspecting the user's home directory and finding a carelessly exposed script executed by root.

## Blue Team Perspective

Nibbles shows how weak admin credential practices and script permission issues can be chained into a full compromise.  
To defend against this:

- Never deploy apps with default credentials  
- Isolate root-owned scripts from user-writeable paths  
- Monitor `.bashrc` and other user-startup artifacts for malicious commands
