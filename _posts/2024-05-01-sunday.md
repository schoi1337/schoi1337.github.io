Sunday exposes a Solaris-based environment with legacy services like NFS and finger enabled by default.
Initial access relied on mounting an exposed NFS share and recovering SSH keys, granting low-privilege access.
Privilege escalation was achieved through a writable cron job owned by root, executing a malicious script placed by the attacker.
While the stack is outdated, it showcases real risks from forgotten configurations in hybrid or mixed OS environments.
This box reminds defenders of the importance of periodic audit and hardening of legacy systems that often get overlooked.

OS: Solaris
