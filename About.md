This blog is my personal workspace 🍵 a place where I document what I learn, break, fix, and discover.  
You’ll find writeups for HackTheBox machines, vulnerability analysis, proofs of concept, and everything in between.

My main focus right now is growing as a cyber security specialist, sharpening my practical skills, and building a career with real-world expertise.

**Things I believe in:**
- **Hands-on experience > Theory**
- **Consistency > Intensity**
- **Progress > Perfection**

If you're curious about my notes, want to discuss ideas, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out.
