This blog is my personal workspace 🍵 a place where I document what I learn, break, fix, and discover.  

You’ll find writeups for Hack The Box machines, my open-source projects, and everything in between.

My main focus right now is growing as a cyber security specialist, sharpening my practical skills, and building a career with real-world expertise.

Things I believe in:
- Clarity > Complexity
- Consistency > Intensity
- Progress > Perfection
- Reproducibility > Shortcuts

If you're curious about my notes, want to discuss ideas, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out.
